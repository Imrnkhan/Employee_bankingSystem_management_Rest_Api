Problem
Create a spring boot application for Employee management





You should maintain employee id, 


<h1>Create a spring boot application for Employee management</h1>

<h3>It should have an employee entity</h3>


<p>First name<br> Last name<br> Email,<br> Phone Number <br> Salary. <br>Salary (yearly Rs)<br>Reporting manager id<br></p>






the reporting manager id will be empty or null for employees like the CEO,CTO or someone who does not have any reporting managers
Every other employee must have a reporting manager
An employee can only have one reporting manager
